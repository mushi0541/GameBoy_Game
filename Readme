# GameBoy: OOP Semester Project

**GameBoy** is a C++ project inspired by the classic GameBoy device, developed by **Mushahid Hussain & Ahmad Bilal** under the supervision of **Sir Aqib Rehman**. The project combines three classic games—Hangman, Snake, and Wordle—along with an integrated leaderboard system. It showcases advanced **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and emphasizes manual implementation of features without relying on vectors or advanced libraries.
