## **GameBoy: OOP Semester Project**

### **Overview**
**GameBoy** is a semester project developed by **Mushahid Hussain & Ahmad Bilal** as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at FAST-NUCES, Islamabad Campus, under the guidance of **Sir Aqib Rehman**. The project is inspired by the classic GameBoy device and integrates three games—**Hangman**, **Snake**, and **Wordle**—into a single application. It showcases core OOP concepts, manual file handling, and graphical implementation using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**.

### **Features**

- **Multiple Games**:
  - **Hangman**: A word-guessing game with visual feedback and a hint system.
  - **Snake**: The classic snake game with dynamic scoring.
  - **Wordle**: A word-puzzle game with feedback for correct/incorrect guesses.
- **Leaderboard**:
  - Displays the top 10 players with scores from all games.
  - Automatically updates and prevents duplicate player entries.
- **Save and Load**:
  - File handling for saving and retrieving game states and high scores.
- **SFML Graphics**:
  - Rich graphical interface for game visuals and leaderboards.

### **Development Details**
- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Manual implementation of arrays and logic without using vectors or advanced STL containers.
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
  - File handling for persistence (scores, states, leaderboard).

### **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GameBoy.git
   ```
2. Install **SFML** and configure it in your development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
4. Build the project in Debug or Release mode.
5. Run the executable and enjoy the games.
